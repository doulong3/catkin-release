   catkin.conf
        A file that lives on a special orphan branch `catkin` in a
        :term:`GBP repository` which contains catkin meta-information (like
        upstream repository location and type) used when making releases with
        catkin.

   cmake current files directory
        A location used by catkin to store intermediate
        files generated by cmake.  Catkin uses
        ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_FILES_DIRECTORY}${CMAKE_FILES_DIRECTORY}``,
        for instance
        ``... build/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp/CMakeFiles``.  (Note
        the ``CMakeFiles`` at the end of that path)

   config-mode infrastructure
        Files named ``<project>-config.cmake`` and
        ``<project>-config-version.cmake`` which are used by cmake's
        ``find_package()`` in "config mode".

   dry
        a package/stack/whatever not yet converted to catkin/FHS build & install.

   Environment files
        The `setup.sh`, `setup.zsh` and `setup.bash` files generated and
        installed by catkin.  See also :ref:`envfiles`.

   FHS
        The Linux `Filesystem Hierarchy Standard <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard>`_

   generated code
        Code generated during the build process, typically by a message code generator package.
        May or may not require compilation.

   GBP repository
        A ``git-buildpackage`` repository.  Contains released
        upstream source and the associated debian build files sufficient
        to assemble binary and source debs.  Catkin-controlled repositories
        also contain a branch ``catkin`` with meta-information.

   package
        generally something "smaller" than a stack... but a package
        can be a stack.

   pkgutil
        Nifty python package:
        http://docs.python.org/library/pkgutil.html

   project
        CMake's notion of a buildable subdirectory: it contains a
        ``CMakeLists.txt`` that calls CMake's ``project()`` macro.

   stack
        unit of installation.  These get made in to debs.

   static code
        Code typed in by a developer, contrast :term:`generated code`

   wet
        a package/stack/whatever already converted to catkin/FHS build & install.
